            <article>
                <p><i>Built between the 5th century B.C. and the 16th century, the Great Wall of <br> China is a stone-and-earth fortification created to protect the borders of <br> the Chinese Empire from invading Mongols. The Great Wall is actually a <br> succession of multiple walls spanning approximately 4,000 miles, making <br>it the world's longest manmade structure</i></p>

                    <p><i>The Art Deco-style <a href="https://www.travelchannel.com/videos/rios-christ-statue-0143901">Christ the Redeemer</a> statue has been towering over <br><a href="https://www.travelchannel.com/destinations/brazil/photos/why-we-love-brazil">Brazilians</a> from upon <a href="https://www.travelchannel.com/destinations/brazil/rio-de-janeiro">Corcovado mountain</a> in an awe-inspiring state of <br>eternal blessing since 1931. The 130-foot reinforced concrete-and- <br>soapstone statue was designed by Heitor da Silva Costa and cost <br>approximately $250,000 to build â€” much of the money was raised <br> through donations. The statue has become an easily recognized icon for <br> Rio and Brazil.</i></p>

                           <a href="https://www.travelchannel.com/destinations/peru/photos/machu-picchu-incredible-inca-ruins">Machu Picchu</a>, an Incan city of sparkling granite precariously perched <br> between two towering Andean peaks, is thought by scholars to have <br> been a sacred archaeological center for the nearby Incan capital of <br> Cusco. Built at the peak of the Incan Empire in the mid-1400s, this <br> mountain citadel was later abandoned by the Incas. The site remained <br> unknown except to locals until 1911, when it was rediscovered by <br> archaeologist Hiram Bingham. The site can only be reached by foot, train <br> or helicopter; most visitors visit by train from nearby Cusco.</i></p>

                    <p><i>The genius and adaptability of Mayan culture can be seen in the splendid <br> ruins of Chichen Itza. This powerful city, a trading center for cloth, slaves, <br> honey and salt, flourished from approximately 800 to 1200, and acted as <br> the political and economic hub of the Mayan civilization. The most <br> familiar ruin at the site is El Caracol, a sophisticated astronomical <br> observatory.</i></p>

                    <p><i>Rome's, if not Italy's, most enduring icon is undoubtedly its Colosseum.<br> Built between A.D. 70 and 80 A.D., it was in use for some 500 years. The<br> elliptical structure sat nearly 50,000 spectators, who gathered to watch <br> the gladiatorial events as well as other public spectacles, including battle <br> reenactments, animal hunts and executions. Earthquakes and stone- <br>robbers have left the Colosseum in a state of ruin, but portions of the <br> structure remain open to tourists, and its design still influences the <br> construction of modern-day amphitheaters, some 2,000 years later</i></p>

                    <p><i>A mausoleum commissioned for the wife of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan,<br> the Taj Mahal was built between 1632 and 1648. Considered the most perfect specimen <br> of Muslim art in India, the white marble structure actually represents a number of architectural <br>styles, including Persian, Islamic, Turkish and Indian. The Taj Mahal also encompasses <br> formal gardens of raised pathways, sunken flower beds and a linear reflecting pool.</i></p>

                    <p><i>Declared a World Heritage Site in 1985, Petra was the capital of the <br>Nabataean empire of King Aretas IV, and likely existed in its prime from 9 <br> B.C. to A.D. 40. The members of this civilization proved to be early <br>experts in manipulating water technology, constructing intricate tunnels <br> and water chambers, which helped create an pseudo-oasis. A number of <br> incredible structures carved into stone, a 4,000-seat amphitheater and <br> the El-Deir monastery have also helped the site earn its fame.</i></p>
